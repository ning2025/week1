        The Moon Rover, often referred to as a lunar rover, is a specialized vehicle designed to traverse
        and explore the Moon’s surface. First conceptualized during the Apollo missions, these rovers
        helped astronauts extend their range of exploration beyond the landing site and conduct a variety of scientific experiments. 
        Modern robotic versions continue this legacy, scouting for useful resources, analyzing lunar geology, and laying the 
        groundwork for future human settlements on the Moon. Through their mobility and advanced sensors,
        Moon Rovers play a critical role in expanding our understanding of Earth’s closest celestial neighbor.
